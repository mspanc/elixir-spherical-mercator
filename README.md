# SphericalMercator

[![.github/workflows/test.yml](https://github.com/mspanc/elixir-spherical-mercator/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mspanc/elixir-spherical-mercator/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This is a port of [MapBox's SphericalMercator JS library](http://github.com/mapbox/sphericalmercator) to Elixir.

The API remains similar, so refer to the original project for documentation.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `spherical_mercator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:spherical_mercator, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/spherical_mercator>.
